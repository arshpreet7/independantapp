        <h1> ENDANGERED WILD ANIMALS</h1> <img id="EE"src="Endangered_animals.jpeg">
        <p>Endangered animals are species where the number of animals living in the wild has been greatly reduced due to a variety of reasons, such as deforestation or changing climate. This means that they are at high risk of dying out in the near future if we don't take any steps to protect them.<br><br>

            Although extinction is a natural phenomenon, with between one and five species becoming extinct each year, we are now losing dozens of species every day. It is estimated that one million species (including plants) will be lost by 2050. Learning facts about endangered animals is the first step to raising awareness about this issue.</p>
