        <h1> HOW DO WE SAVE THEM?</h1> 
        <p><b>Go Vegan!</b><br>
            Going vegan means that you stop eating, wearing, or using anything that came from an animal, such as meat, milk, eggs, and leather. Just by going vegan, you'll save the lives of nearly 200 animals a year. Pretty awesome, right?<br><br>

        <b>Complete an Action</b><br>
    We've got a list of super-easy ways to help animals, and you can earn stickers and comic books for taking part! We post action ideas all the time, so there are always new ways for you to spread the word about animal rights and get free stuff. It's a serious win-win situation.<br><br>

    <b> Don't Support Animals in Entertainment</b><br>
    Animals want to be in their natural habitatâ€”they don't want to entertain us. Those used in movies, circuses, and roadside zoos usually can't be with their families, graze, or explore, which are all things they like to do. Refuse to support this cruelty by never going to a roadside zoo, a marine park, or a circus that uses animals.<br><br>
    
    <b> Cut Out Dissection</b><br>
        If your class is planning to dissect animals, ask your teacher for a humane activity instead, such as using a computer program to perform a virtual dissection. An animal will be saved, and you'll learn and remember way more.<br><br>
